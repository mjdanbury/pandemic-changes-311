## The Traces That Our Pandemic Lives Left In New York City's 311 Data

I used this project as an opportunity to pursue a question that I had been sitting on for a while: How did the coronavirus pandemic affect 311 complaints in New York City holistically? 

I had seen similar pieces on this topic — one by Larry Buchanan on world wide pandemic related trends, and another by The Chronicle on San Francisco's 311 data, but to my knowledge, no one had done one for New York's 311 data specifically. 

A lot of the work of this project was simply looking through thousands of timeseries plots of unique 311 service request types and taking note of which ones had a distinct feature that coincided with the start of the pandemic. 

If I decide to revisit this project in the future, I will almost certainly spend my efforts reporting out some of the interesting trends I noticed in the data. While I bounced questions off of people who had lived in the city during the pandemic while interpreting some of the plots, each could honestly be a feature story unto itself.
